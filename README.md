# Coupled Nonlinear Optical Waves (CNOW)

Coupled Nonlinear Optical Waves (CNOW) solves the nonlinear coupled amplitude equations for an arbitrary number of waves with user-specificed boundary conditions (input waves). CNOW uses Newton's method with Crank-Nicolson finite differencing.

CNOW was developed by Ian Williamson <ian.williamson@utexas.edu>.
